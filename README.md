# My Home assistant addons

Just add `https://github.com/Benio-B/hassio-addon` to Home Assistant Add-on repositories list.

Some add-ons may don't run. I tested them once and try to get functional so "it works on my machine" as they say.

Currently, 4 add-ons, some are forked, some are created from scratch:
- [PairDrop](https://github.com/Benio-B/hassio-addon/tree/main/pairdrop)
- [Rclone Backup](https://github.com/Benio-B/hassio-addon/tree/main/rclone_backup)
- [Cron Bash boilerplate](https://github.com/Benio-B/hassio-addon/tree/main/cron_bash_boilerplate)
