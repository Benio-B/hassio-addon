# Repo test for cron run file with HASS add-on

This is just a boilerplate to :
- Run cron in Hass Add-on
- Get args in bash script and run it
- Get persistence in data folder and config folder
- Get persistence data in share folder
- Create automatically link between Docker:/config and HA:/addon_configs/<my-addon>
